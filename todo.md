# TODOs

## Diataxis

Follow diataxis framework:
Create tutorials, guides etc.

## Subdomains?

Patching the documentation to exist under `/rust-doc` is very bloody difficult
but we have to figure it out (mostly because the links aren't relative and
backflip whenever it feels like it). We could make a subdomain but that'll end
up being complicated if we use github pages.
