Welcome to the official `lux` documentation.

Here you will find all sorts of resources ready to get you
started on your Lua journey!

## What is Lux?

`lux` is a package manager for [Lua](https://lua.org). Its purpose is to manage
Lua projects, dependencies, build scripts and more for you, so you
can focus on writing and shipping Lua code.

:::info

`lux` is still in beta but very close to a stable `1.0` release.
It's not a full, comprehensive replacement to [`luarocks`](https://luarocks.org) yet, and there may
be bugs here and there!
